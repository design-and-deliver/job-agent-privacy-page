  <h1>Privacy Policy for JobAgent</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 4, 2025</p>

  <p>
    JobAgent is a Chrome extension that helps users evaluate job listings. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information you may provide while using the extension.
  </p>

  <strong>Data Collection</strong>
  <p>
    JobAgent does not collect personally identifiable information such as name, email, or address. However, to function properly, the extension may process content from webpages you visit when you manually activate the tool.
  </p>

  <strong>Data Usage</strong>
  <p>
    Any webpage content processed by the extension is used locally or securely transmitted to our AI services to analyze job listings. No data is shared with third parties outside of our service providers.
  </p>

  <strong>Permissions</strong>
  <p>
    The extension uses host permissions only when you activate it on a specific page. This enables functionality such as text extraction for job analysis.
  </p>

  <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
  <p>
    JobAgent may interact with secure remote APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude) for content analysis. These services are used solely to provide requested features and results.
  </p>

  <strong>Security</strong>
  <p>
    We implement appropriate technical measures to ensure that user data is handled securely.
  </p>

  <strong>Changes to This Policy</strong>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
  </p>

  <strong>Contact</strong>

    If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@jobagent.ai">team@proswitch.ai</a>.
